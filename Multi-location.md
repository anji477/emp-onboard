Database Schema Changes Needed
-- Add location support
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN location ENUM('Chennai', 'UK') DEFAULT 'Chennai';
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN timezone VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Asia/Kolkata';

-- Location-specific settings
CREATE TABLE location_settings (
  location VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
  working_hours JSON,
  holidays JSON,
  compliance_requirements JSON
);

-- Regional policies
ALTER TABLE policies ADD COLUMN applicable_locations JSON;
ALTER TABLE document_templates ADD COLUMN location_specific BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;


This multi-location architecture would make the application suitable for your Chennai and UK offices while maintaining centralized management capabilities.
